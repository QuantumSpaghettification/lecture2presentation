# What is this program

This takes a .tex file as input and uses text-to-speech software and keyword searches to turn it into a presentation.

# Installing

- Download the folders above (currently all are required) into a folder e.g. ./l2p/
- then simply run python3.5 on the readertex.py file.
- assuming you have all modules etc (including the latex once) then you should be ready to go.

# Known Problems

Some papers are currently known not to work, due to their formating. I will try to fix these as I come across them.
